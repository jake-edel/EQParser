    (rare). You can reach the Archon using levitate, gaining enough height by
    running up one of the corner obelisks and then "bouncing" up the
    inwardly-slanted walls of the pyramid until you reach the roof. Before
    bouncing up, view the next level to make sure any patrolling lizard with see

    thrown into the pits below where you will surely be eaten by swarms of
    hungry gators. During busy times this area can support two groups, with
    "Archon CY" being the secondary camp, feeding off the obelisk lizards on the
    lowest level.
